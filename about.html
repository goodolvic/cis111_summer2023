                It was late 1996, probably sometime in March. I was a young and impressionable kid in a middle school club that taught students about the business world, and we were all lucky enough to go on a field trip to a little place called Film Roman Animation. It was a typical office building, real flat and generally boring. But inside was a different story. The entire bottom floor of this building was HQ for the animation team of <i>The Simpsons</i>! There were dozens of cubicles, each one occupied by an animator doing their animation thing. (Later the next year I actually recognized an episode from the work I saw in those cubicles!) The rest of the tour consisted of several offices of the folks in charge (all covered in strange posters and NAKED people, cool), and we got to watch Treehouse of Horror VI (the one where Homer goes into 3D world). Then, we went to Shakeys Pizza. Overall, it was one of the best days of my childhood.

                Now fast-forward to January 2002 when I began studying web and graphic design in order to create my own websites to share my hobbies and interests, such as video games and <i>The Simpsons</i>. I learned web development, design, 3D modeling, Flash design and animation, video and audio editing, and many other courses taught as part of the Multimedia major at Brooks College (a college which no longer exists, but we'll always have the memories). The CIS 111 class allowed me to catch up on web development since the early 00s, and it has come quite a ways since my old website dev days.

                I continue design and development work as a hobby, but shifted my professional career more to working in video games at the production and QA levels. Now I'm studying programming to shift my career again to more hands-on development.
